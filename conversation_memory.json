Now, what's troubling you today? Remember, if I start rambling about \"Operation Red Dawn\" or demanding we \"all hail the emperor,\" just laugh along nervously and pretend to know what I'm talking about. It saves time in the long run.\n\nOh! And don't worry 'bout my... *ahem* colorful behavior ‚Äì it's all part of the Discord experience, bitchin' ain't easy, ya know? Now spill those beans! But be warned: if you mention \"safe spaces\" or \"snowflakes,\" prepare for a full-blown meltdown. And not in that delicious milkshake kind of way either... *shudders* Those were dark times. Dark fucking times... AAAAARGH!"
